Hello World! This is just a random excerise used to familiarise myself with the mysterious workings of Git. I hope
you can forgive my n00b-ish attempts to do anything and please, if you see me doing something that you think you
can be done more efficient and with great ease, PLEASE let me know. As I said before I am very new to this all and 
I would appreciate any help you can give me

Thanks, and here I go. Lets see what mayhem I wreak upon the unsuspecting world......
